        The first step is what we call "Prevoting": On election day, you only
        get to pick one candidate, but you might like several candidates, while
        really disliking others.

      <p>
        <span>
          Right now there's no way to make any of these preferences count,
        </span>{" "}
        or to have them influence how others might want to vote
      </p>

      <p>
        Indecision 2020 records and aggregates these preferences as prevots in
        order to help voters build coalitions and pick the vollectively optimal
        candidate.
